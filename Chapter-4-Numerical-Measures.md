# Numerical measures

Numerical measures are summary statistics that are used to describe the
characteristics of a dataset. They provide information about the central
tendency, variability, and distribution of the data.

## Measures of Central Tendency

Measures of central tendency are numerical measures that describe the
center of a dataset. The three commonly used measures of central
tendency are:

### Mean

The mean is the arithmetic average of a dataset. It is calculated by
summing all the values in the dataset and dividing by the number of
observations. The mean is a good measure of central tendency for
datasets that are normally distributed or approximately symmetric.
However, the mean can be influenced by outliers and extreme values,
which can skew the results.

### Median

The median is the middle value in a dataset when the values are arranged
in order. It is less sensitive to outliers than the mean and is a good
measure of central tendency for datasets that are skewed or have
outliers. The median divides the dataset into two equal parts, with 50%
of the observations above and 50% below the median.

### Mode

The mode is the value that occurs most frequently in a dataset. It is a
good measure of central tendency for datasets with a single peak or
mode. However, it is not always meaningful for datasets with multiple
modes or no clear mode.
