# Probability

The foundation of statistical inference is the theory of probability. It
tells the likelihood of an event occurring. Probability measures the
likelihood that a specific event will occur, expressed as a number
between 0 (impossible) and 1 (certain). An event is likely of unlikely.

## Frequentist definition

If an experiment is repeated n times under essential identical
conditions, and if the event A occurs m times, then as n grows large,
the **ratio of m/n** approaches to a fixed limit that is probability of
A:

The probability of event A is given by:

$$\huge P(A) = \frac{m}{n}$$

-   P(A) = Probability of event A

## Law of large numbers

The Law of Large Numbers is a fundamental concept in probability that
states that as the number of trials or observations increases, the
average of the results obtained from these trials will converge to the
expected value.
