# Data

Data in statistics refers to any set of observations or measurements
that are collected from a particular population or sample. This can
include numerical data, such as measurements of height, weight, or
income, as well as categorical data, such as responses to survey
questions or demographic information.

Data is used in statistics to make inferences or draw conclusions about
the larger population from which the data was collected. This involves
using statistical methods to analyze the data and identify patterns or
relationships between variables.

There are many different types of statistical analyses that can be used
depending on the type of data being analyzed and the research question
being addressed. For example, descriptive statistics can be used to
summarize and describe the main features of a dataset, while inferential
statistics can be used to make predictions or test hypotheses about the
population based on the data collected from a sample.

In order for data to be useful in statistical analyses, it must be
collected in a systematic and unbiased manner, and must be
representative of the larger population from which it was drawn. This
involves using appropriate sampling methods and ensuring that any biases
or confounding factors are accounted for in the analysis.
