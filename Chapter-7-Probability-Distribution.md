# Probability Distribution

A probability distribution describes how the values of a random variable
are distributed. In simpler terms, it tells us which outcomes are likely
and how likely they are.

## Discrete vs continuous Distribution

### Discrete Distributions

Discrete Probability Distributions apply to scenarios where the random
variable can take on a finite or countable number of values (e.g.,
rolling a die).

### Continuous Distribution

Continuous Probability Distributions apply to scenarios where the random
variable can take any value within a certain range (e.g., the height of
people).

## Key components of probability distributions

### Probability Function

For **discrete variables**, this is called the **probability mass
function (PMF)**. For **continuous variables**, itâ€™s called the
**probability density function (PDF)**.

### Cumulative Distribution Function

It gives the probability that the random variable is less than or equal
to a certain value.
