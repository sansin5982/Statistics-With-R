# Bias

Bias in sample selection occurs when the sample chosen for a study or
survey is not representative of the population being studied. This can
lead to inaccurate or misleading results because the sample may not
accurately reflect the opinions, characteristics, or behaviors of the
entire population.

There are several types of bias that can occur in sample selection:

**1- Selection bias**: This occurs when certain groups or individuals
are systematically excluded from the sample selection process. For
example, if a study on the health of a population only selects
participants from a single hospital or clinic, the results may not be
representative of the health of the entire population.

**2- Volunteer bias**: This occurs when individuals who volunteer for a
study or survey are not representative of the entire population. For
example, if a study on a new drug only includes individuals who are
willing to participate in the study, the results may not be
representative of the entire population.

**3- Sampling frame bias**: This occurs when the sampling frame used to
select the sample is incomplete or inaccurate. For example, if a study
on internet usage only includes individuals who have access to the
internet, the results may not be representative of individuals who do
not have access to the internet.

**4- Measurement bias**: This occurs when the measurement tools or
techniques used in the study are not accurate or reliable, or when the
measurements are taken differently for different groups of participants.
For example, if a study on income only asks participants about their
annual income and not their total income, the results may not accurately
reflect the income of the entire population.

To minimize bias in sample selection, researchers should use appropriate
sampling techniques that are representative of the population being
studied, such as probability sampling techniques. It is also important
to use valid and reliable measurement tools and techniques, and to
analyze the data using appropriate statistical methods.

# Sampling Techniques

Sampling techniques are methods used to select a representative subset
of a population for study or analysis. There are several sampling
techniques, each with their own strengths and weaknesses, and the choice
of sampling technique depends on the research question, the population
of interest, and the available resources.

## Probability Sampling Techniques

Probability sampling techniques are methods of selecting a sample from a
population that use random selection, **ensuring that every member of
the population has an equal chance of being selected for the sample**.
Probability sampling techniques are generally considered to be more
representative of the population than non-probability sampling
techniques. Here are some examples of probability sampling techniques:

**1- Simple random sampling**: In simple random sampling, a sample is
selected randomly from the population, with each member of the
population having an equal chance of being selected for the sample.

**2- Systematic sampling**: In systematic sampling, the population is
divided into a list and a sample is selected at a fixed interval. For
example, if a population has 1000 members and a sample of 100 is
desired, every 10th member of the population would be selected.

**3- Stratified sampling**: In stratified sampling, the population is
divided into strata based on some characteristic of interest, and a
random sample is selected from each stratum. Stratified sampling ensures
that the sample is representative of each stratum in the population.

**4- Cluster sampling**: In cluster sampling, the population is divided
into clusters, and a random sample of clusters is selected for study.
Within each selected cluster, all members of the population are sampled.

**5- Multi-stage sampling**: Multi-stage sampling is a combination of
several sampling techniques, such as cluster sampling and stratified
sampling. In multi-stage sampling, the population is divided into
clusters, and a random sample of clusters is selected. Within each
selected cluster, sub-clusters are randomly selected, and the process
continues until individual members of the population are selected.

Probability sampling techniques are preferred over non-probability
sampling techniques because they provide a more representative sample of
the population. However, probability sampling techniques can be more
complex and time-consuming than non-probability sampling techniques, and
may require larger sample sizes to achieve the desired level of
precision.

## Non-probability Sampling Techniques

Non-probability sampling techniques are methods of selecting a sample
from a population that do not use random selection, and do not ensure
that every member of the population has an equal chance of being
selected for the sample. Non-probability sampling techniques are
generally considered to be less representative of the population than
probability sampling techniques. Here are some examples of
non-probability sampling techniques:

**1- Convenience sampling**: In convenience sampling, the sample is
selected based on convenience or accessibility. For example, if a
researcher wants to study college students, they might select a
convenience sample of students who are available and willing to
participate in the study.

**2- Quota sampling**: In quota sampling, the researcher sets quotas for
certain subgroups of the population, and then selects individuals to
fill those quotas. For example, a researcher might set a quota for a
certain percentage of male and female participants, and then select
individuals to fill those quotas.

**3- Purposive sampling**: In purposive sampling, the sample is selected
based on a specific purpose or criterion, such as selecting individuals
who have a certain characteristic or who have experienced a particular
event. For example, a researcher might select individuals who have
experienced a natural disaster for a study on disaster recovery.

**4- Snowball sampling**: In snowball sampling, participants are
selected based on referrals from other participants. For example, a
researcher might start with a few individuals and ask them to refer
others they know who meet the study criteria.

Non-probability sampling techniques are generally less preferred than
probability sampling techniques because they may introduce bias into the
sample selection process and the resulting sample may not be
representative of the population. However, non-probability sampling
techniques can be useful in certain situations where probability
sampling techniques are not feasible or practical, such as in small
populations or when conducting exploratory research.
